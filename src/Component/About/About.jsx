              <p>It is no more clean vs green, it is clean & green</p>
              <p>In the housekeeping segment, the cleaning performance and greener products are always considered as two sides of coins. Higher or quicker the cleaning performance, lesser the green product and vice versa. We mastered the art of balancing these two poles by following a sustainable and comprehensive approach right from raw material sourcing to production to distribution to end product usage and disposal. The sustainability is achieved and maintained through green chemistry and safe germ protection formula. Thus vooki is not a choice between clean and green but is your chance to stay green and experience top notch performance. Yes, vooki products are Type 1 Eco Label certified by GEN (Global Ecolabelling Network).</p>
